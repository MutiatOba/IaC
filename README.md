### What is infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as code (IaC) enables you to use code to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and other components of an IT environment.

IaC tools, such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, and Puppet, can use the code or configuration files to create, configure, and manage infrastructure resources. IaC allows for the automated provisioning of infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way, which can reduce errors and increase efficiency in managing infrastructure at scale.
